= Earth Energy Budget
Earth Energy Budget is a calculated Figure of the flow of energy, in radiation.

== Radiation

#problem[
  Why global warming?
  ]
Global warming has nothing to do with green house gases.

#definition("Shortwave Radiation")[ 
  Shortwave radiation. Most radiation emmited by sun is short-wave.
]

#definition("Longwave Radiation")[
  Longwave radiation. wave that reflescted from the ground.

#theorem("Wein's Law")[
  $ lambda _max = b / T $
  Where b is constant, T is the temperature.
]
#theorem("Plank's Law")[
  $ B_nu (nu,T) = (2 h nu ^3) /c^2 1/(exp((h nu)/(k_beta T)) -1) $
]
#theorem("Bolzmann")[ 
 For an ideal absorber/emitter or black body, the Stefan–Boltzmann law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area per unit time  is directly proportional to the fourth power of the black body's temperature, T:
 $ M ^o = sigma T^4$

Note the absorption of water vapor in all part of the spectrum and the absorption of $C O_2$.

= Suggested Research Topic

 #problem[Application of Remote Sensing in Climate Change Monitoring. ]
Students can study how to use satellite remote sensing data to monitor changes in the Earth's environment that are caused by #highlight("anthropogenic climate change"). This monitoring can include changes in the Earth's surface temperature or the extend of the Earth's glaciers and sea ice coverage, using #highlight("advanced satellite retrieval") methods.

#problem[The rise and fall of greenhouse gases since the last ice age. ]
Climate changes across the past 24,000 years provide key insights into Earth system responses to external forcing. Global climate change has become a global problem as a result of accelerated human activity and industrialization. Since the Industrial Revolution, the rate of global warming has increased considerably compared to the rate of paleoclimatic warming. Comparing the #highlight("rate of warming") since the Industrial Revolution with the rate of paleoclimatic warming is of great significance for understanding the impact of human activities on global climate change and provides a scientific basis for formulating measures to address climate change.

#problem[Paleo-perspectives on Arctic warming. ]
Ice is more reflective and less absorbent of sunlight than land or the surface of an ocean. When ice melts, it typically reveals darker areas of land or sea, and this results in increased sunlight absorption and associated warming. #highlight("Polar amplification") is much stronger in the Arctic than in Antarctica. What effects is Arctic amplification having, both in the region and for the world? And How we explain Arctic warming in Paleo-perspectives?

#definition("ISSCCP-h")[
  The Cloud Properties - International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) H-Series Climate Data Record (CDR) focuses on the distribution and variation of cloud radiative properties to improve understanding and modeling of the way clouds affect climate. This dataset provides an improved understanding of the radiation budget, as well as specific insight on the relationship between clouds and the radiation balance. These data can be used to support many other cloud studies, including efforts to understand the long-term global hydrologic cycle. The dataset period of record includes data from 1983 to 2018.
